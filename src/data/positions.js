    description: "Served as the Support Team Manager for the FNB App Academy initiative from May 6, 2025 to July 4, 2025. The support team was responsible for assisting a diverse student population of over 200,000 students nationwide. We were responsible for offering vital assistance, guidance, and mentorship on the use and benefits of the course to thousands of students, many of whom were engaging with app-based tools for the first time. My job was to manage and direct the support team by assigning each support member a Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Goal for the Program, and providing them with continuous updates. I also assisted many of the students myself, by helping them with their code, answering many of their questions, and hosting live interactive training and support sessions with them. In addition to this, I had to always be planning ahead, making decisions, and finding the best solutions to many of the problems and challenges encountered by both the students as well as the entire Support Team as a whole, in turn giving all members a more satisfactory feeling and work experience.",
