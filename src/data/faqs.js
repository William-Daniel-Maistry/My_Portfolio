    question: "What is your process for building a website from scratch?",
    answer: "My process typically starts with understanding the client's goals and vision. From there, I design wire frames (whenever necessary), build the site using the relevant programming languages, frameworks and technologies, and incorporate interactive elements and animations. I also ensure the site is SEO-optimized by adding appropriate meta tags (including OG tags for social media sharing) and setting up a solid content structure for search engines. I ensure the final product is supported by and tested across all screen sizes and web browsers before launch."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Do you implement animations on your websites?",
    answer: "Yes! I use CSS animations to enhance user interaction and engagement. Animations can be subtle (such as hover effects) or more dynamic (like page transitions or scrolling effects), depending on the project. These elements make the website feel modern and interactive while maintaining performance."

    id: 7,
    question: "How do you handle version control for projects?",
    answer: `I use <strong><em>Git</em></strong> and <strong><em>GitHub</em></strong> for version control to keep track of changes made to the website's code. This allows for easy collaboration, version tracking, and code backups, ensuring that all changes are documented and can be rolled back if necessary.`
  },

    id: 8,
    question: "How long does it take to build a website?",
    answer: "The timeline for a project depends on its complexity. A simple website might take a few days to a week, while a more complex multi-page website could take a few weeks to several months.
